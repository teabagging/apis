## How to

1. Create a repository on GitHub ([**`<your-username>/<your-repo>`**](https://github.com/typicode/demo))
2. Create a **`db.json`** file
3. Visit [https://my-json-server.typicode.com/**`<your-username>`/`<your-repo>`**](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo) to access your server

**No registration.** Nothing to install.

## Example

You can check the following server as an example:
[https://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/typicode/demo)

## Beta

For the moment, the project is in **beta** which means many things may change or break:

* URLs may change
* Service may be down
* Authentication may be added later
* etc...

Use it at your own risk. If you need a **reliable** solution, please **install** [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server).

## Limits

To be able to provide a free service to as many people as possible during this phase, the project comes with a few limits:

* **Changes are faked and aren't persisted** (just like [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/))
* Requests are cached (`1 minute`)
* `db.json` has limits
* All servers are `public`
* Private GitHub repositories aren't supported (yet)

## Roadmap

I hope to be able to support private repositories later and plan to improve this service regularly. To be notified of updates, you can follow me on Twitter [@typicode](https://twitter.com/typicode).
